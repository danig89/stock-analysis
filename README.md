# Analysis of Stock from 2017 and 2018

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to compare stock performance between the year 2017 and 2018, using refactored VBA script in Microsoft Excel. The goal was to determine if refactoring would increase the efficiency of the original VBA script.
<br>

## Results
### Stock Performance in 2017 and 2018
<br>
Table 1: All Stock Data for 2017
<br>

<br>
<br>
Table 2: All Stock Data for 2018
<br>

<br>
<br>
From the displayed data, it is apparent that majority of all the stocks performed better in 2017 than 2018. For example, in 2017, the return rate for DQ was 199.4%; however, in 2018, it performed at -62.6%. ENPH had a return rate of 129.5% in 2017 but did not perform as well in 2018 (81.9%). ENPH is the only stock that performed well in both years. 
<br>
For both 2017 and 2018, TERP would not have been a wise stock to invest in, performing at -7.2% and -5.0%, respectively. There was a slight improvement in return rates of TERP from 2017 to 2018.
<br>
RUN is the only stock that improved from one year to the other, increasing 78.5%.
<br>
<br>

### Analysis of VBA Code Runtime
<br>
<br>
Using the original VBA code to analyze stock data from 2017, the runtime 0.9570313 seconds.
<br>

<br>
<br>
The refactored code resulted in a runtime of 0.25 seconds.
<br>

<br>
<br>
Using the original VBA code to analyze stock data from 2018, the runtime 0.9765625 seconds. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
The refactored code resulted in a runtime of 0.234375 seconds.
<br>

<br>
<br>
Overall, the refactored VBA code proved to improve the efficiency of the original script by lowering the runtime of the stock analysis for both years.
